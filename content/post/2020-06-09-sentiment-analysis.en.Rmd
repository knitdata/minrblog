The TF-IDF is computed by multiplying two terms:TF and IDF. TF is the normalized term frequency and IDF is the inverse document frequency.
Therefore, the formula for TF-IDF is TFxIDF 

where,
$$\text{TF} = (\frac{\text{number of times term appears in a document}}{\text{Total number of terms in the document}})$$
and
$$\text{IDF} = \ln(\frac{n_{\text{ documents }}}{n_{\text{document containing term}}})$$
TF-IDF can be used for ranking important documents(page ranking). For example when we google a term COVID-19, the results are displayed in order of relevance. TF-IDF gives searched word(COVID-19) a higher score. 

### TF-IDF on Gutenberg books

```{r}
library(pacman)
p_load(gutenbergr,tidyr,tidyverse,tidytext,forcats,
       genius)
```

```{r}
#books on mathematics from project glutenberg
math_books <- gutenberg_download(c(16449,25664,17001,16713), meta_fields = "title")
```


```{r}
#frequencies of words in each book
math_words <- math_books %>% 
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>% count(title, word, sort = TRUE)
math_words
```


```{r}
#tf-idf
tfidf_mathbooks <- math_words %>%
  bind_tf_idf(word, title, n) %>%
  mutate(word = fct_reorder(word, tf_idf)) %>%
  mutate(title = factor(title, levels = c( "The Number Concept: Its Origin and Development","The Earliest Arithmetics in English", "An Elementary Course in Synthetic Projective Geometry","Amusements in Mathematics")))
tfidf_mathbooks
```



```{r}
#bargraphs
tfidf_mathbooks %>% 
  group_by(title) %>% 
  top_n(15, tf_idf) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, tf_idf)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, tf_idf, fill = title)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  facet_wrap(~title, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() + ggtitle("Bargraphs of top 15 words")
```


Amusements in Mathematics - This book appears to be related to solving puzzle and game.

An Elementary Course in Synthetic Projective Geometry- It appears to be related to book about measuring angle and point, probably involve a lot of theories.

The Earliest Arithmetics in English - The terms are interesting. The words in various langauge in original form. 

The Number Concept: Its Origin and Development - It appears to be related how counting and numbering originated. It is probably indicating use of fingers by tribes for counting.



***Same analysis using bigrams.**


```{r}
# bigrams for the math books from previous problem
math_bigrams <-  math_books %>%
unnest_tokens(bigram, text, token = "ngrams", n = 2)
math_bigrams
```

```{r}
# count bigrams
math_bigrams %>% count(bigram, sort = TRUE)
```


```{r}
# separate and filter stop words
mathbigrams_separated <- math_bigrams %>%
separate(bigram, c("word1", "word2"), sep = " ")

mathbigrams_filtered <- mathbigrams_separated %>%
  filter(!word1 %in% stop_words$word) %>%
  filter(!word2 %in% stop_words$word)

# new bigram counts
bigram_counts <- mathbigrams_filtered %>% 
  count(word1, word2, sort = TRUE)
bigram_counts

```


```{r}
#combine filtered words to form bigrams 
mathbigrams_united <- mathbigrams_filtered %>%
  unite(bigram, word1, word2, sep = " ")
mathbigrams_united
```

```{r}
bigram_tf_idf <- mathbigrams_united %>%
  count(title, bigram) %>%
  bind_tf_idf(bigram, title, n) %>%
  arrange(desc(tf_idf))
bigram_tf_idf
```


```{r}
#bargraphs
bigram_tf_idf %>% 
  group_by(title) %>% 
  top_n(15, tf_idf) %>% 
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(bigram=reorder(bigram, tf_idf)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(bigram, tf_idf, fill = title)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "tf-idf") +
  facet_wrap(~title, ncol = 2, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip() + ggtitle("Bargraphs of top 15 bigrams")
```
