<p><strong>Word cloud</strong> is a text mining technique to visualize words that give greater prominence to the word appearing more frequently.</p>
<p>In the following sections, we will build word clouds of data science job description in few steps using R. Let’s get started.</p>
<div id="create-a-text-data" class="section level3">
<h3>1. Create a text data</h3>
<p>Our data set contains job description of data scientist, data analyst and data engineer from three US cities - San Francisco, Seattle and New York. File named ds.txt is a collection of 50 job descriptions.</p>
</div>
<div id="load-packages" class="section level3">
<h3>2. Load packages</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>pacman::p_load(tm,wordcloud,wordcloud2, RColorBrewer)</code></pre>
<p>Note: p_load() of pacman package loads other packages in R without needing to download them. tm is for text mining - corpus, text cleaning and document term matrix. wordcloud is to generate word cloud and RColorBrewer is for color palettes.</p>
</div>
<div id="load-text-data" class="section level3">
<h3>3. Load text data</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>data_science &lt;- readLines(&quot;ds.txt&quot;)
data_science &lt;- gsub(&quot;[^A-Z  a-z]&quot;, &quot;&quot;, data_science) # keep characters only</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="text-cleaning" class="section level3">
<h3>4. Text cleaning</h3>
<p>First, load data as a corpus. Corpus contains a list of document. In this case, we have one document.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_corpus &lt;- Corpus(VectorSource(data_science))</code></pre>
<p>Secondly, we remove words that don’t add context i.e. stop words including some words that are irrelevant in our analysis. Additionally, we utilize other text cleaning techniques.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>data_clean &lt;- tm_map(data_corpus,removePunctuation)
data_clean &lt;- tm_map(data_clean,removeWords, c(stopwords(&quot;en&quot;), &quot;you&quot;,
&quot;data&quot;,&quot;will&quot;,&quot;science&quot;, &quot;etc&quot;, &quot;andor&quot;, &quot;including&quot;))
data_clean &lt;- tm_map(data_clean, stripWhitespace)
data_clean &lt;- tm_map(data_clean, tolower)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="document-term-matrix" class="section level3">
<h3>5. Document Term Matrix</h3>
<p>Our data is in unstructured form. To do further analysis, we convert data to tabular format. This can be achieved via a document term matrix(dtm) which displays a word with its frequency in matrix format.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>dtm_data &lt;- TermDocumentMatrix(data_clean)
m &lt;- as.matrix(dtm_data) # convert to matrix
v &lt;- sort(rowSums(m), decreasing = TRUE)
df &lt;- data.frame(word = names(v), frequency = v)
head(df,10) # top 10 words</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                    word frequency
## experience   experience       210
## learning       learning        68
## business       business        67
## models           models        61
## you                 you        57
## machine         machine        56
## work               work        53
## strong           strong        53
## engineering engineering        51
## ability         ability        51</code></pre>
<p>Let’s visualize with bar plot.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>w &lt;- rowSums(m)
w &lt;- subset(w, w&gt;=17)
barplot(w,
        las = 2,
        col = rainbow(25))</code></pre>

</div>
<div id="generate-world-cloud" class="section level3">
<h3>6. Generate world cloud</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1999) # for reproducibility
wordcloud(words = df$word,freq = df$frequency, min.freq = 17,
max.words = 80, random.order = F, rot.per = 0.35, scale = c(4, .5), colors = palette())</code></pre>
<p><img src="/post/2020-07-03-word-cloud/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>wordcloud2 package is a great alternative to create interactive word cloud.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(2000)
w &lt;- data.frame(names(v), v)
colnames(w) &lt;- c(&#39;word&#39;, &#39;freq&#39;)
wordcloud2(w,
           size = 0.70,
           shape = &#39;star&#39;,
           rotateRatio = 0.45,
           minSize = 2)</code></pre>

<p>That’s how we build a word cloud. The most used keywords standout better in a word cloud. World clouds are easy to understand descriptive tool, visually engaging, simple yet impactful. However, analysis are limited to the insights of data. More extensive statistical analysis may be required for deep understanding of the data.</p>
