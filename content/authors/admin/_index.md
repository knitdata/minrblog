My background is in applied statistics, data science and QA engineering. I am passionate in using analytics for extracting hidden insights. 

I live in the Bay Area, California. I love hiking, reading, listening Data Science podcast and audible. I am looking to connect with the data people to gain and share insight and ideas. If you would like to connect, please leave a message. 

This is a data science blog built with R package [blogdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/index.html), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),[GitHub](https://github.com/knitdata/minrblog), and deployed through [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
